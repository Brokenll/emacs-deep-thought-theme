emacs-deep-thought-theme
========================

an Emacs 24 theme created while under the influence of a pan-dimensional, hyper-intelligent species of beings (whose three dimensional protrusions into our universe are ordinary white mice) to come up with the Answer to The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. ... well. ok, perhaps not ( crib-sheet : answer is 42 )
